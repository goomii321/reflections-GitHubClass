When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    可以和其他人協作或分享自己的程式

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    手動雖然麻煩,但比較不會出現衝突和錯誤,全部交給自動同步可能導致錯誤

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork:線上倉庫之間的複製; clone: 線上倉庫和本地倉庫間的複製; branches: 建立程式的分支

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    若是有衝突,可以先在本地做好修改以後,再上傳避免衝突

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    應該就是各寫各的,然後最後都寄給某個人讓他處理合併程式的工作? 如果沒有git&github協同工作會更困難也更耗精力

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    當我有想要測試或嘗試的實驗性項目的時候, 就會想要開一個新分支來做試驗, 如果直接在master上的話怕會有bug, 當然若只是很小的改動, 也許直接在master上修改會比較省時間
